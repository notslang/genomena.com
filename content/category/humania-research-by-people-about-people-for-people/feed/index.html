<p>On the map, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Kol">Son-köl</a> is just a blue blot in the rugged contours of central Kyrgyzstan. But it&#8217;s the heart, we&#8217;d heard, of yurt country. We had to go.</p>
<p>So after a long climb through dusty valleys, gas generator-lit villages and glacial streams, we pitched a haphazardly-sited camp in cold darkness. Meteors streaked above as we fell asleep, wondering what landscape awaited.</p>
<p>Come dawn, tent flaps zipped back to reveal a turf plateau 3150m above sea level, ringed by dark, smoothly snowpatched mountains. On the vast green expanse, herds of horses swarmed over hillocks, and hawks rode air currents in the shimmering distance. The lake, a low blue sliver, pierced the plain&#8217;s western edge. Just discernible along its shore were a few off-white dots; more of these were visible through binoculars on the grassy slopes sweeping around us. Blue smoke tufted from some. Yurts.</p>
<p>Round wood-frame tents, covered in cloth and hide, are inhabited by nomadic herders across much of central Asia. The dwellings vary in name (Kazak <em>kisü</em>, Mongolian <em>ger</em>), but their portable, sturdy design has the widespread consistency of a classic. If you&#8217;re roaming San-köl&#8217;s grasslands &#8212; stalking a yak, marmot, Bactrian camel, or columbine, or just minding your own business &#8212; you&#8217;ll eventually find yourself drawn irresistibly yurtward, into the Black Hole of Kyrgyz hospitality. Some wizened horseman or bright-eyed youngster will approach out of the windblown waste and beckon you home for a visit. Accept &#8212; it&#8217;s a chance for fascinating insight into the detail of local life.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/yurtframe-1024x680.jpg" alt="Yurt-raising, Pamir valley, Kyrgyzstan" title="yurtframe" /></p>

<p>The first thing you may notice, after doffing your shoes (kept either just inside or just outside the tiny door) to enter, is that the floor is incredibly soft and cushy. Thick felt rugs called <em>shyrdak</em> are piled to insulate against cold and rocky ground beneath. Adjusting to the dim interior light, you’ll see rugs made by two main methods. Stacked variegated felt sheets may be cut as one — often in coarse symbolic figures such as stylized ram’s horns — and the cutouts fitted to their other-color complements, yielding sets of sharply patterned rugs. Or a big swirl of raw wool may be pressed and dyed in similar traditional motifs to yield a cruder (but often plusher) pad. Either way, yurts are cozy.</p>
<p>Most we&#8217;ve seen are about 4 to 8m across (depending on the neighborhood) and 2 to 3m high at the center skylight vent. A dung stove and maybe a hand-cranked churn typically sit just inside the painted wood door, with a low platform table &#8212; square to the door &#8212; toward the back, and sundry possessions (storage chests and bladders, clothes, utensils, lutes, drying meat, wool processing tools etc.) jam-packed neatly on the wall. The wall itself is supported by a latticed wood frame, and the dome by long spiral ribs; at a yurt-raising in a high Pamir meadow, we saw first hand how the owners tied the frame with wool ribbon for stability.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/yurtdoor-742x1024.jpg" alt="Pamir valley, Kyrgyzstan" title="yurtdoor" /></p>

<p>Yurts seem to accomodate about 3 to 7 residents &#8212; reasonable for a nuclear family plus a grandparent or two, though kinship relations of inhabitants we met weren&#8217;t always clear; at one Son-köl yurt, two apparent husband-wife teams milked mares tied to a line outside. This tricky job involves keeping a colt near each nervous mare throughout her short sessi on; the thin milk ferments to make that staple of the steppe, <em>kumys</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to the horses commonly tied within view of the door, each yurtstead we saw had a makeshift stock pen and a simple ridge tent for some cooking and odd jobs. Nomadic herding looks like a hard life, with plenty of work to go round in summer, when rich highland pastures are accessible. In September most of the families we met will haul their packed yurts down to valley settlements and dig in for winter. All the more surprising, then, that they were so hospitable in this time of focused work. Maybe it&#8217;s the thrill of new faces in an isolated place, but we were cajoled time and again by strong-willed new friends into a cup or two of kumys – some light, some stingingly acidic – and some jovial conversation. Ushered to comfortable floor spots around the back of the table, we&#8217;d sit longer than planned, tearing at rounds of egg or malt bread, scooping up rich curdled butter and exchanging questions and answers (as complex as our phrasebook would allow) about each other&#8217;s lives. One woman took a three-string <em>qomyz</em> from the wall and strummed a contemplative Kyrgyz tune in the sunbeam. We all fell quiet listening.</p>

<p>Anthropologists are divided on whether nomadic cultures like this one tend to emerge before or after the local establishment of agriculture. Some argue that nomads always depend on settled cultures for crucial goods and services, while others point out that a scarcity of archeological evidence for nomads preceding settled agriculturalists may just reflect lack of material accumulation in temporary settlements (like yurts). Whatever its origins, the itinerant herding lifestyle has deep roots at Son-köl, where <em>kurgans,</em> scattered low mounds visible as you look out across the basin, mark burial sites of early Indo-European nomads. Today, their Turkic-speaking, yurt-dwelling successors keep them dogies rollin&#8217; along&#8230;.</p>

<p>Schoolgirls at the tomb of Sa&#8217;di, Shiraz, Iran (image copyright Nathaniel Pearson)</p>
<p>Just before it happens I&#8217;m on a gritty street, where the bazaar&#8217;s damp breath spills from brick tunnels into searing daylight. Bins of apricots, wine-bruised plums, ivory rice and pale dried limes surround, along with bales of mint, copper coils, mountains of bright plastic jugs, calf&#8217;s heads laid on newsprint, and flatbread grills curling wood smoke into the leaves. An overripe smell of sewer and fruit, the kaleidoscope of goods, and the human tumult threaten sensory overload, so I train my camera on a small scene: a man chopping frosty ingots from a kerbside ice block. Kids gather &#8212; eager to see a tourist in action &#8212; and then a bearish man with a red-black beard steps through the ring of gawkers.</p>
<p>Hazy-eyed, swaying slightly as if drunk (a rare spectacle here), he greets me with a stream of unregistered Farsi and an enormous grin. I&#8217;m used to Iranian friendliness, but something more &#8212; a hint of urgency &#8212; comes through as this man, calling himself Abbas, grabs my arm and starts introducing me to merchants. We wend through the bustle, under an archway where old men contemplate tea, and into a dusty courtyard ringed by a raised stone walkway below rows of heavy wooden doors.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/abbas-1024x682.jpg" alt="Abbas and friend, Shiraz, Iran" title="abbas" /></p>
<p>Abbas and friend, Shiraz, Iran (image copyright Nathaniel Pearson)</p>
<p>Abbas beckons three loiterers across the yard; they talk in lively tones, laugh and urge me to the raised walkway. My guard&#8217;s up. Despite many warm welcomes, and the low crime rate in Iran, I&#8217;ve now been led without explanation to an empty enclosure by a pro-wrestler lookalike who knows I have a Nikon. The few other folks around seem friendly, but their patter could as easily be hostile &#8212; we&#8217;ve all seen some hapless foreigner getting mocked under a guise of sudden camaraderie.</p>
<p>At the end of the walkway Abbas fishes for keys. A door is thrown open; I peer into musty darkness, baffled. Then a violent flutter of wings. A mottled shape explodes into light, another, then a swirl of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon">pigeons</a> overhead. Abbas intently scatters feed; birds settle, pulse into the air, scuffle for food. He hands one to me: dark slate feathers, heel tufted regally, sideways gaze switching calmly. My fingers feel a heart purring under spiny ruffles &#8212; a captured bundle of wild flight, like a moment withheld from time. I heave her skywards, spinning wings into motion like water over a mill wheel, and marvel. Abbas beams.</p>
<p>Well before Abbas was born here, Shiraz was home to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez">Hafez</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_(poet)">Sa&#8217;di</a>, two of Iran&#8217;s most revered poets (and they do revere them here). Before arrival, I wondered what about the place had inspired these guys to apparently take Persian writing to completely new levels. Did something in the soil, the local wine or the barren surrounding make Shiraz an oasis of imagination? Did Sa&#8217;di&#8217;s example simply fire up Hafez to raise the bar a hundred years later? Just chance? I came to town wondering where you go to find the poetry.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/versebird2.jpg" alt="Finch of fortunes, Tehran, Iran" title="versebird2" /></p>
<p>Finch of fortunes, Tehran, Iran (image copyright Nathaniel Pearson)</p>
<p>When seeking the muse in Iran, follow the birds. There&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.sgiquarterly.org/feature2008Jan-4.html">nightingale courting the rose</a>, the mythical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_bird">Homa</a> (Iran Air&#8217;s logo), <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/queen_of_sheba,_drawing.aspx">hoopoe</a>, and of course the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simurgh">Simorgh</a>, Sufi symbol of unity that&#8217;s at once thirty birds and just one. You can have your fortune told on the street by tethered finches who pick envelopes containing portentous Hafez verses. The popularity here of avian symbols &#8212; especially of life&#8217;s journey &#8212; is no surprise: Iran&#8217;s isolated wetland basins make great pit stops for millions of migrating birds. I knew I was onto something when Abbas pointed at one of his dots in the sky and conveyed that it could fly all the way to the USA and find its way right back to Shiraz.</p>
<p>So, things I can tell you how to find in this town: a hand-beaten cauldron (the bazaar); a black market money-changer (right in front of the police station); <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faloodeh">falude</a> sherbet, made from vermicelli (the teahouse at Hafezieh); and a mural of a mullah in sunglasses (north side of Bazaar-e Nou bridge). Poetry? The bazaar&#8217;s pretty big, so maybe they&#8217;ve got it in there somewhere &#8212; I really don&#8217;t know. My best advice is to let it find you.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/samarkandcycle-691x1024.jpg" alt="" title="SamarkandCycle" /></p>
<p>In fabled Samarkand I met my match. Don&#8217;t worry, nobody got hurt &#8212; it turns out we&#8217;re family. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In 1996, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Wells">Spencer Wells</a> and Ruslan Ruzibakiev collected a then unprecedented set of DNA samples from central Asian people. Back at Stanford, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalli-Sforza">Luca Cavalli-Sforza</a>&#8216;s laboratory assessed diversity among the men among them, and among others from around the world, at about a dozen sites on the Y-chromosome, compiling a database of each man&#8217;s DNA sequence at each site, which jointly define his <em>partial haplotype</em>. Because the Y chromosome passes largely unchanged from father to son, if two men&#8217;s partial Y haplotypes match &#8212; site for site &#8212; they likely share a fairly recent male line ancestor. The matches could conceivably be long-lost brothers, but we more safely assume they&#8217;re distant cousins. And (with some simplifying assumptions) we can infer that their common forefather likely lived within the last thousand years or so &#8212; a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.</p>
<p>Back then I was working in the Cavalli lab, and, out of curiosity, threw my own partial haplotype into the emerging database. Lo and behold, it matched a few others: a western Uzbek; two guys from New Delhi; and Sharif, a Tajik from Samarkand, who I decided to look up when our Eurasia &#8217;98 expedition rolled into his hometown.</p>
<p>With just a name and age to go on, first stop, in this post-Soviet urban quest, was the &#8216;address office&#8217;. Perhaps fittingly, no Samarkandskis[1] I queried knew the actual address of the address office &#8212; but a helpful cabbie vaguely recalled it being near the local macaroni factory. Following the pasta lead, in fifteen minutes I had Sharif&#8217;s address in hand.</p>
<p>Accompanied to the place by our collaborator Nadira, who could explain this bizarre visit in Russian, I rapped on the door. Sharif&#8217;s wife welcomed us into the courtyard, heard our story, and promptly explained that Sharif was, unluckily for us, off exploring America. In disappointment I began to wonder if some Y-chromosome gene might relate to intercontinental wanderlust; maybe our forefather was a peripatetic Silk Road trader&#8230;</p>
<p>To Sharif&#8217;s wife&#8217;s likely relief, we explained that despite the Y-chromosome malarkey I was <em>not</em> her husband&#8217;s unknown American son. I asked if Sharif did have a son or brother (who would also share our forefather) in town. Luckily, their son was home, and, on meeting us, proudly brought out photos of his dad. Maybe it&#8217;s a stretch, I thought, but Sharif could pass as an uncle in my family.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/tajikgirl1-1024x700.jpg" alt="&quot;Tajik" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that simple of course. Go back <em>n</em> generations, and you have 2 to the <em>n</em> ancestral lineages &#8212; in principle. In reality, all those ancestors were themselves related by descent, but the point is that one shared lineage doesn&#8217;t necessarily make people look distinctly similar. Even so, the Y-chromosome is a big chunk of DNA to have in common, and researchers have just begun to understand its genetic functionality. Here&#8217;s some background on what Y-haplotype comparison can tell us, and who that forefather of me and Sharif might have been.</p>
<p>DNA in the core of a human cell, the nuclear genome, typically comprises 46 long pieces called chromosomes, half inherited from the mother and half from the father. Between generations, DNA is copied precisely, so that the genomes of close relatives tend to be more alike than those of distantly related people. But some intergenerational change s do occur, so that no two people &#8212; not even &#8216;identical&#8217; twins &#8212; have exactly the same DNA. This genetic diversification helps make individuals unique and, over time, facilitates human adaptation to the changing environments we face.</p>
<p>The Y-chromosome is unique in passing only from father to son (women have a second copy of another chromosome, the X). At one copy per cell, the Y has no closely matched partner chromosome with which to swap pieces of DNA, a process called recombination. Without recombination things simplify, because sites which are polymorphic (i.e., where DNA sequence varies between individuals) stay linked over generations on one length of DNA. With some caveats, the modern global distribution of these intact haplotypes &#8212; representing male lineages &#8212; can tell us about the geographic movements of reproductive men in the past. The caveats? First, differing haplotypes can, over generations, change to become alike, so that some matches may not descend from that inferred common ancestor. How likely this is depends on how rare changes are at a given site; we try to learn enough about mutation processes to pick for study sites with appropriate rates of change. Second, we generally assume that mutation rates and the human generation interval are steady over space and time, letting us estimate age of lineages (e.g. a thousand years); in reality, complex factors affect the process of genetic diversification, so time guesses are inherently imprecise.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/serai-1024x682.jpg" alt="Traders" /></p>
<p>Despite such restrictions, the population-level frequency of Y-chromosome haplotype matches, and the near matches that let us connect lineages into networks, can tell us a lot about how human groups are related historically. At the level of single samples, like mine and Sharif&#8217;s, conclusions are harder to draw. Sharif&#8217;s Tajiks are Persian speakers who likely migrated from Iran to Samarkand before the heyday of the Silk Road and the arrival of Islam, admixing with people already living in the region and with Turkic and other groups who arrived later. My recent ancestors were Ashkenazi Jews in Ukraine; that population likely migrated by several routes from the Levant to eastern Europe, over the last two thousand years, admixing with Indo-European- and Turkic-speaking populations along the way. The shared influence of Indo-European (e.g. Persian, Russian), Semitic, and Turkic gene flow in my and Sharif&#8217;s background could be one clue to how we came to have such a recent common ancestor. That both Jews and Tajiks were active on the Silk Road about a thousand years ago is another. But to guess at our putative forefather&#8217;s ethnicity, we would need to examine the frequency of haplotypes similar to ours in many regional populations. Which is, on a larger scale, exactly what the Eurasia &#8217;98 expedition was conceived to do. But who knew it would get so personal?</p>
<p>[1] Not a real word, by the way!</p>
<p>[This piece, by Nathaniel Pearson, originally appeared in 1998.]</p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE: A few years after Eurasia &#8217;98, I was living in Chicago, and got a call out of the blue. A hoarse, unfamiliar voice spoke to me in insistent Russian, and repeated a name until it sank in. It was Sharif. Aided by an English-speaking brother who soon joined the call, he wanted to let me know that his wife had given him my number, and that, as he was once more in the United States, he hoped to repay my visit to his Samarkand home by coming to meet me. A few months later, he followed through. Our meeting proved surprisingly emotional; though mutual language barriers made communication halting, we shared more about our lives, and pored over sheafs of family photos, contemplating the faces of new distant cousins. Sharif had also brought me an unexpected gift: a brocade robe, richly embroidered in traditional, gold-threaded Tajik motifs on a velvety midnight blue. Trying it on, I nearly swam in the folds of cloth, looking a bit like Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer&#8217;s Apprentice (apparently, Sharif&#8217;s wife hadn&#8217;t told him how tall I was). And, most strikingly, I learned that Sharif and his family had just moved to New York City. In doing so, they had joined a new wave in the same longterm tide of transatlantic migration that drew my forebears westward, two generations back. Our own shared forefather, who perhaps plied the Silk Road many centuries before, might have been proud to know.</p>

<p>Rockface tombs, near Takht-e Jamshid (image copyright Nathaniel Pearson)</p>
<p>The Eurasia &#8217;98 sampling expedition collected about 120 DNA samples from residents of three major Iranian cities: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esfahan">Esfahan</a> and <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shiraz">Shiraz</a>, both populated mainly by families settled locally for many generations, and <a href="http://wikipedia.org/tehran">Tehran</a>, a fast-growing capital which draws immigrants from across the country (and from Afghanistan) to yield a diverse population type that demographers term <em>cosmopolitan</em>.</p>
<p>Shiraz is the main city in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fars_Province">Fars</a>, the region lending its name to Iran&#8217;s chief language, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farsi">Farsi</a>, and to the Europeanized name Persia. Many Shirazis told the expedition team that their families have lived in the region for as long as they know. Roughly 2500 years ago, Fars was the capital of the empire of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I">Darius I</a>, whose dominion spanned from Ethiopia to India. His capital near Shiraz, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis"><em>Takht-e Jamshid</em></a> (known to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_great">Alexander</a>&#8216;s ransacking Macedonians as Persepolis) preserves a remarkable picture of the empire&#8217;s human diversity: detailed stone friezes of a tribute procession show delegates from many subjugated populations wearing and bearing the trappings of their cultures. Today, Shiraz attracts immigrants mainly from the nearby coastal regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushehr">Bushehr</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Abbas">Bandar (&#8216;Port&#8217;) Abbas</a>. Just a short sea passage separates this coast from the Arabian Peninsula, and some of the locals, broadly called Bandaris, speak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabic">Arabic</a> at home; Arab genetic influx may have historically been greater here than anywhere else in Iran. Shiraz also has a significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lor_people">Lor</a> population, centered in a region just to the north; many informants said Lors might have admixed less than most Iranians with other populations. If this is true, ancestral Iranian genotypes might be very common in this population.</p>

<p>Esfahan, another regional capital, occupies a high plain between Shiraz and Tehran. Even more so than in Shiraz, locals we sampled claimed homogenous &#8216;Esfahan-Fars&#8217; ancestry. However, in the past &#8212; especially during the era of Shah Abbas&#8217; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid">Safavid</a> court (about 400 years ago) &#8212; the city&#8217;s population was very cosmopolitan. In addition to Persians, significant numbers of Arabs, Armenians, Jews and Turks may have influenced current genetic diversity in Esfahan.</p>
<p>Tehran, in north-central Iran near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alborz_Mountains">Alborz</a> mountains and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea">Caspian</a> basin, is a teeming city of over 10 million, with fast-growing population and infrastructure. Tehrani sample donors had ancestry in places all over the country, and here we sampled several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Azarbaijan">Azeri</a>, Turkic-speaking members of Iran&#8217;s largest ethnic minority (variously estimated as 20-40% of the national population), whose settlement is densest in the northwest, near the Republic of Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>As foreign scientists, we needed very detailed planning and permission for sampling in Iran, and we&#8217;re excited not only to have succeeded in our initial sampling goals but also to have forged a strong collaboration with Tehran scientists who will have access to more of Iran&#8217;s diverse inhabitants. In addition to sampling more Lor, our collaborators will send samples from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrians_in_Iran">Zartushti</a> (Zoroastrians), now centered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazd">Yazd</a> and closely related to Indian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsee">Parsi</a> people, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazara_people">Hazara</a>, northeasterners who claim Iranian soccer star and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329/">Jackie Chan</a> lookalike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khodadad_Azizi">Khodadad Azizi</a> as their own. Hazara in Iran reportedly speak Farsi as a first language, but, for an Iranian population, they may show unusually great genetic affinity to central Asian populations. This highlights one of our main reasons for sampling in Iran: on the southwestern margin of the central Asian region, the country&#8217;s genetic diversity can provide insight into population movements, such as the Indo-Aryan and Islamic expansions, which may have been traced in Spencer&#8217;s 1996 sampling further east.</p>
